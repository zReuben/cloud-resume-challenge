      <h3>ðŸŽ“ Background & Experience</h3>
      <p>
      Iâ€™m an AWS Certified Solutions Architect â€“ Associate with a BE and MS in Computer Engineering. My masterâ€™s included an advanced certification in Networking & Wireless Communication, fueling my interest in cloud infrastructure. After several years developing and supporting mission-critical hardware, I transitioned into agile product leadership roles. Iâ€™ve led scrum teams, owned roadmaps, and driven growth in cybersecurity and aerospace â€” and now, Iâ€™m bringing that experience into the cloud.

      <h3>ðŸ”§ Why This Site Exists</h3>
      <p>
      This site is part of the <strong>Cloud Resume Challenge</strong>, a full-stack cloud project designed to showcase real-world skills in <strong>AWS</strong>, <strong>DevOps</strong>, and <strong>Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</strong>. Itâ€™s more than a resume, itâ€™s an evolving technical portfolio demonstrating how I approach architecture, automation, and secure cloud deployment.

      <h3>âœ… What Iâ€™ve Built So Far</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Configured the <strong>AWS CLI</strong> and secured access with <strong>AWS Vault</strong> to use temporary credentials backed by <strong>MFA</strong></li>
        <li>Set up <strong>least privilege IAM</strong> practices by creating a separate scoped-down user account (ReubenDev) for development and deployment</li>
        <li>Purchased a domain from a registrar and configured <strong>DNS routing</strong> to AWS by pointing the domain to my CloudFront distribution using <strong>Route 53</strong></li>
        <li>Provisioned and validated an SSL certificate using <strong>AWS Certificate Manager</strong> to enable HTTPS for the custom domain</li>
        <li>Used <strong>AWS SAM</strong> and <strong>CloudFormation</strong> to define and deploy infrastructure-as-code, including S3, Route 53, and Certificate Manager resources</li>
        <li>Deployed the site on <strong>Amazon S3</strong> for static hosting and integrated it with <strong>CloudFront</strong> for global delivery</li>
        <li>Customized and styled the site using a modern <strong>HTML + CSS template</strong> to present content cleanly and professionally</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>ðŸ“ˆ Whatâ€™s Next</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Implement a visitor counter using <strong>JavaScript</strong> on the frontend, backed by a <strong>Lambda function</strong>, <strong>DynamoDB</strong>, and <strong>API Gateway</strong></li>
        <li>Write backend logic in <strong>Python</strong> using the <strong>boto3</strong> SDK and add unit tests to ensure reliability</li>
        <li>Set up <strong>CI/CD pipelines</strong> using <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> to automate deployment of both frontend and backend code</li>
        <li>Enhance <strong>monitoring and logging</strong> with <strong>CloudWatch</strong> to track API usage and detect issues</li>
        <li>Refine <strong>IAM policies</strong> for the Lambda role to ensure least-privilege execution</li>
        <li>Simulate a basic <strong>AWS Organizations</strong> setup to explore multi-account structure, billing separation, and cost control best practices</li>

      <h3>ðŸŽ¯ Career Focus</h3>
      <p>
        I'm looking to join a forward-thinking team where I can apply my blend of product strategy and technical depth. I'm especially interested in roles in <strong>cloud-native product management</strong>, <strong>cloud engineering</strong>, <strong>DevOps</strong>, or <strong>solutions architecture</strong>, particularly in industries like <strong>SaaS</strong>, <strong>cybersecurity</strong>, or <strong>cloud infrastructure</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also open to opportunities at well-funded <strong>startups</strong> and smaller technical teams where I can contribute broadly, grow alongside the organization, and help build systems that scale.
