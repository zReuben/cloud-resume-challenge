      <h3>ðŸŽ“ Background & Experience</h3>
      <p>
      Iâ€™m an AWS Certified Solutions Architect â€“ Associate with a BE and MS in Computer Engineering. My masterâ€™s included an advanced certification in Networking & Wireless Communication, fueling my interest in cloud infrastructure. After several years developing and supporting mission-critical hardware, I transitioned into agile product leadership roles. Iâ€™ve led scrum teams, owned roadmaps, and driven growth in cybersecurity and aerospace, and now, Iâ€™m focused on building in the cloud where my background and interests align.

      <h3>ðŸ”§ Why This Site Exists</h3>
      <p>
      This site is part of the <strong>Cloud Resume Challenge</strong>, a full-stack cloud project designed to showcase real-world skills in <strong>AWS</strong>, <strong>DevOps</strong>, and <strong>Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</strong>. Itâ€™s more than a resume, itâ€™s an evolving technical portfolio demonstrating how I approach architecture, automation, and secure cloud deployment.

      <h3>âœ… What Iâ€™ve Built So Far</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Set up <strong>AWS Organizations</strong> with separate accounts for management, development, test, and production environments</li>
        <li>Secured administrative access using <strong>AWS Vault</strong> and <strong>MFA-protected temporary credentials</strong> across accounts with delegated roles and scoped permissions</li>
        <li>Purchased a domain and configured <strong>Route 53</strong> DNS routing to a <strong>CloudFront</strong> distribution backed by a validated SSL certificate from <strong>AWS Certificate Manager</strong></li>
        <li>Defined all infrastructure using <strong>AWS SAM</strong> and <strong>CloudFormation</strong>, including S3, CloudFront, Route 53, Certificate Manager, API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB</li>
        <li>Deployed a <strong>serverless visitor counter</strong> using Lambda functions triggered by API Gateway and persisting data to DynamoDB</li>
        <li>Integrated <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> for CI/CD to automate testing and deployment of both frontend and backend across environments</li>
        <li>Implemented <strong>AWS Budgets</strong>, <strong>SNS alerts</strong>, and a <strong>Lambda-powered kill switch</strong> to prevent runaway costs in case of misconfiguration or malicious traffic</li>
        <li>Hosted the site statically on <strong>Amazon S3</strong>, served globally via <strong>CloudFront</strong>, and styled with a responsive <strong>HTML + CSS layout</strong></li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>ðŸ“ˆ Whatâ€™s Next</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Implement a visitor counter using <strong>JavaScript</strong> on the frontend, backed by a <strong>Lambda function</strong>, <strong>DynamoDB</strong>, and <strong>API Gateway</strong></li>
        <li>Write backend logic in <strong>Python</strong> using the <strong>boto3</strong> SDK and add unit tests to ensure reliability</li>
        <li>Set up <strong>CI/CD pipelines</strong> using <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> to automate deployment of both frontend and backend code</li>
        <li>Enhance <strong>monitoring and logging</strong> with <strong>CloudWatch</strong> to track API usage and detect issues</li>
        <li>Refine <strong>IAM policies</strong> for the Lambda role to ensure least-privilege execution</li>
        <li>Simulate a basic <strong>AWS Organizations</strong> setup to explore multi-account structure, billing separation, and cost control best practices</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>ðŸŽ¯ Career Focus</h3>
      <p>
        I'm looking to join a forward-thinking team where I can apply my blend of product strategy and technical depth. I'm especially interested in roles in <strong>cloud-native product management</strong>, <strong>cloud engineering</strong>, <strong>DevOps</strong>, or <strong>solutions architecture</strong>, particularly in industries like <strong>SaaS</strong>, <strong>cybersecurity</strong>, or <strong>cloud infrastructure</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also open to opportunities at well-funded <strong>startups</strong> and smaller technical teams where I can contribute broadly, grow alongside the organization, and help build systems that scale.
